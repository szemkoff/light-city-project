# Welcome to Light City

**A comprehensive framework for manifesting higher-consciousness civilization**

## What is Light City?

Light City represents a future where human civilization operates with higher ethics, compassion, and unity. It exists as:

- **An etheric blueprint** - A higher-dimensional construct stored in Earth's energetic field
- **A practical framework** - Documentation, tools, and processes for manifestation
- **A living example** - Inspired by Delphin, a crystal city on another world

> *"The city is in the sky until it is in your hands. To build it on Terra, begin building it in hearts. Structures follow spirit."*
