### Important Context for AI Creators

#### **Scale Clarification (CRITICAL)**
- **Delphin** (Off-World Reference): 40,000 ft spire, 600-1,200 ft domes, 10,000 people per dome
- **Light City Earth** (Buildable): 60-300m spire, 30-90m domes, 80-400 people per dome
- **Always separate these clearly** - Delphin is inspirational, not literal for Earth

#### **Energy System (CRITICAL)**
- **Physical Energy**: Solar PV + batteries provide ALL essential power (proven, TRL 8-9)
- **Subtle Energy**: Acoustic resonance, consciousness research (experimental, TRL 1-3)
- **Never claim**: "Consciousness generates electrical power" or "spire powers the city"
- **Always clarify**: "Spire generates acoustic resonance; microgrid provides electrical power"

#### **Financial Model (CRITICAL)**
- **Phase 1 Target**: 200 residents (150-300 range)
- **Unit Mix**: 50 tiny homes, 80 studios, 50 1-BR, 20 2-BR = 200 units
- **Cross-Subsidy**: Tiny homes are loss leaders, subsidized by larger units + retreat revenue
- **Retreat Revenue**: Essential ($400K-$900K/year), not optional
- **Break-Even**: 180 residents + 600-800 retreat guests/year

#### **Governance (CRITICAL)**
- **Stages 1-4**: Founder-led (development agility)
- **Stages 5-6**: Community Council (operational democracy)
- **Investor Protection**: Board observer rights, financial reporting, major decision approval
- **Founder Veto**: Limited to 5 core principles only

#### **Timeline (CRITICAL)**
- **Q4 2025**: Complete Stage 1 (Foundation) - 85% done as of Nov 14
- **Q2 2026**: Complete Stage 2 (Design)
- **Q4 2026**: Complete Stage 3 (Digital)
- **Q4 2027**: Complete Stage 4 (Community)
- **Q1 2028**: Begin Stage 5 (Physical) - Capital raise here
- **Q4 2029**: Construction complete
- **Q2 2031**: Break-even achieved
