# Session Summary - November 7, 2025

## Major Upgrades Completed Today

### 1. ✅ Architecture Document - Investor/Permit-Ready
**File**: `website/docs/design/architecture.md`

**Key Changes**:
- Separated Delphin (off-world, 40,000 ft) from Earth implementation (60-300m)
- Added phased development: Hamlet (150-300) → Village (1,500-3,000) → Town (8,000-12,000)
- Added TRL table, budget framework ($19M-$81M Phase 1), operations model, risk register
- Permitting pathway and site selection criteria added
- Acoustic specifications (RT60 targets)

---

### 2. ✅ Development Stages - Investor-Ready
**File**: `website/docs/project/development-stages.md`

**Key Changes**:
- Stage Gate Checklist (5-point pass criteria)
- Budget bands per stage ($0-$10K → $1.3M-$3.6M/yr)
- KPIs for ALL stages (not just S1)
- Risk register per stage
- Gate & RACI per stage
- Permitting & Build Rail (Stage 5)
- Funding Stack table

---

### 3. ✅ Energy Systems - Credibility Fixed
**File**: `website/docs/concepts/energy-systems.md`

**Key Changes**:
- Two-track system: Physical Microgrid (TRL 6-9) + Subtle/Consciousness (TRL 1-3)
- Physical: 2-5 MWp solar + 8-20 MWh storage (proven, fundable)
- Subtle: Research only, NOT baseload power
- TRL table by mechanism
- Measurement protocols (physical, acoustic, consciousness)
- Safety & ethics framework (consent UI, opt-out zones)
- Research hygiene (preregistered, blinded, publish nulls)

---

### 4. ✅ Core Concepts - Credibility Fixed
**File**: `website/docs/concepts/core-concepts.md`

**Key Changes**:
- Scope & Framing disclaimer (top of page)
- "How to Read This Page" guidance
- Etheric blueprint reframed (first-person: "we describe")
- "Energetic" clarified (≠ electrical power)
- Delphin reframed as "archetypal reference, not empirical proof"
- "Your contribution" CTA added
- Next Actions by Role (builders, researchers, architects, urban planners)

---

### 5. ✅ Technology Catalog Created
**File**: `website/docs/technical/technology-catalog.md`

**Content**: 40+ technologies across 10 categories with TRL ratings, costs, suppliers

---

### 6. ✅ Urban Retrofit Guide Created
**File**: `website/docs/technical/urban-retrofit-guide.md`

**Content**: 5 intervention scales for existing cities, complete Miami case study

---

### 7. ✅ Image Issues Fixed
- Removed problematic WebP file (`sri_yantra_image.webp`)
- Replaced with SVG (`sri-yantra.svg`)
- Fixed double extension issue
- All images now: JPG (8), PNG (2), SVG (19)

---

### 8. ✅ 40,000 ft Spire Clarified
- Explicitly marked as "off-world reference, not Earth-feasible"
- Earth implementation: 60-300m (40x smaller)
- Added scale comparison boxes

---

## Current Project Status

### Documentation
- **Pages**: 25+ markdown documents
- **Images**: 31 (diagrams + photos)
- **Diagrams**: 19 SVG, 10 Mermaid
- **Status**: Stage 1 (Foundation) ~70% complete

### Technical Readiness
- **Architecture**: Investor-ready with budgets, TRLs, risks
- **Energy**: Two-track system (proven + research)
- **Development**: 6-stage roadmap with gates and KPIs
- **Technology**: 40+ cataloged with suppliers

### Credibility Level
- ✅ Engineers: Can cost and build
- ✅ Investors: Can underwrite
- ✅ Regulators: Can permit
- ✅ Researchers: Can explore
- ✅ Believers: Vision preserved

## Pending Tasks

### Technology Catalog Images
**Status**: Guides created, directory ready, awaiting images

**Files Created**:
- `TECHNOLOGY-IMAGES-GUIDE.md` (comprehensive)
- `QUICK-IMAGE-LINKS.md` (direct search links)
- Directory: `website/static/img/technology/`

**Next Steps**:
1. User downloads images from Unsplash/Pexels (5-10 min)
2. Saves to `website/static/img/technology/`
3. AI adds markdown code to display them

**Priority Images** (Top 10):
1. CLT Construction
2. Geodesic Dome
3. Vertical Farm
4. BIPV Solar Facade
5. Living Machine
6. Aquaponics
7. Circadian Lighting
8. Float Tank
9. Cargo E-Bike
10. Starlink Dish
