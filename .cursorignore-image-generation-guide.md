## 📝 NOTES & BEST PRACTICES

### **Iteration Strategy**
1. **Generate 4 variations** per prompt
2. **Select best** based on composition, accuracy, mood
3. **Refine prompt** if needed and regenerate
4. **Optimize** for web (WebP, multiple sizes)
5. **Test** on actual homepage before committing

### **Quality Control Checklist**
- ✅ Matches Light City aesthetic (purple/gold, sacred geometry)
- ✅ Photorealistic or intentionally artistic (no uncanny valley)
- ✅ No visible artifacts or errors
- ✅ Proper lighting and composition
- ✅ Diverse, inclusive representation (when humans present)
- ✅ Technically accurate (architecture, technology)
- ✅ Optimized file size (<500KB for large images)
- ✅ Accessible (clear subject, good contrast)

### **Common Issues & Solutions**

**Issue**: Generated image too sci-fi/unrealistic  
**Solution**: Add "photorealistic," "architectural photography," "documentary style" to prompt

**Issue**: Wrong colors or mood  
**Solution**: Explicitly specify Light City colors (purple #667eea, gold #FFD700) and mood

**Issue**: Humans look awkward or fake  
**Solution**: Reference "candid photography," "documentary style," "natural expressions"

**Issue**: Architecture doesn't match specs  
**Solution**: Include specific dimensions (30-90m domes, CLT structure, triangular panels)

**Issue**: File size too large  
**Solution**: Compress to WebP at 80-85% quality, generate responsive sizes
