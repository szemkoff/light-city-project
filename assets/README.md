## File Naming Conventions

### Images
- Use descriptive, lowercase names with hyphens
- Include version or date when relevant
- Examples:
  - `central-spire-concept-v1.png`
  - `city-layout-2025-10.jpg`
  - `sacred-geometry-overlay.svg`

### Models
- Include software format in name
- Version when iterating
- Examples:
  - `central-spire-v1.blend`
  - `temple-complex.skp`
  - `city-layout.obj`

### Audio/Video
- Include type, date, and version
- Examples:
  - `light-city-ambient-v1.mp3`
  - `vision-tour-2025-10.mp4`
  - `soundscape-central-plaza.wav`

## Attribution

When using external assets:
- Create an attribution file in the same directory
- Note source, creator, and license
- Respect all licensing requirements

Example: `inspiration/ATTRIBUTIONS.md`

## Storage Considerations

### Large Files
- Consider Git LFS (Large File Storage) for large assets
- Alternatively, use cloud storage and link to files
- Keep repository size manageable

### Backups
- Maintain separate backups of original high-resolution files
- Project repository may contain optimized versions
