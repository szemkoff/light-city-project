# Light City Project

## Vision

**Light City** symbolizes a future collective reality where human civilization operates with higher ethics, compassion, and unity. It represents:

- A literal etheric city — a higher-dimensional construct sometimes called a "city of light"
- A blueprint stored in Earth's energetic field (Gaia's memory)
- A personal vision of a place meant to be built — either physically or energetically — during your lifetime

> *"The city is in the sky until it is in your hands. To build it on Terra, begin building it in hearts. Structures follow spirit."*

## Project Overview

This project serves as a living documentation and development space for manifesting the Light City vision through multiple dimensions:

- **Conceptual**: Philosophical and spiritual foundations
- **Creative**: World-building, design, and artistic expression
- **Technical**: Digital tools, platforms, and experiences
- **Practical**: Community building and real-world implementation
