# Visual Language

*Principles, patterns, and design tokens that give Light City its recognizable look and feel*

## Purpose

This guide defines the visual system used across all Light City materials (documents, diagrams, concept art, web, and potential physical signage). It ensures coherence, beauty, and resonance with the Light City ethos.

## Core Principles

- **Light as material**: Light is a primary design element, not decoration.
- **Crystalline clarity**: Faceted, precise, and harmonious compositions.
- **Sacred geometry**: Circles, spirals, golden ratio, Platonic solids underpin layouts.
- **Unity in diversity**: Consistent system with room for creative expression.
- **Nature-integrated**: Forms echo mountains, crystals, water, sky.

## Design Tokens

### Color Roles (see `color-and-light.md` for palette values)

- Primary: Celestial Blue
- Secondary: Solar Gold
- Accent: White-Gold Highlight
- Support: Deep Space Blue, Mist Gray
- States: Success (Emerald), Caution (Amber), Critical (Rose)

### Typography

- Headings: Geometric humanist sans (e.g., "Inter", "Avenir", or similar)
- Body: Readable sans (e.g., "Inter"/"Nunito Sans")
- Mono (technical): "JetBrains Mono"/"Fira Code"
- Line length: 60–80 chars
- Heading rhythm: 1.25 modular scale

### Iconography

- Stroke-based, rounded joins, 1.5px–2px weight
- Geometry-derived icons (circle, hexagon, triangle)
- Avoid skeuomorphism; prefer abstract sacred forms

### Spacing & Grid

- 8pt spacing system (8, 16, 24, 32, 48, 64)
- Layout grid: radial for city diagrams; 12-col for documents/web
- Golden ratio overlays for hero compositions

## Imagery System

- Architecture: Crystalline, semi-transparent, luminous
- Nature: Forests, water, sky—integrated with structures
- People: Diverse, contemplative, collaborative; respectful
- Effects: Subtle bloom, diffraction, volumetric light

## Geometry Library

- Circle, Vesica Piscis, Seed/Flower of Life
- Spirals (logarithmic, Fibonacci)
- Platonic solids; Merkaba
- Toroidal fields (for energy diagrams)

## Diagram Conventions

- Line color: Deep Space Blue (#0B2447) at 70% opacity
- Highlight paths: Celestial Blue
- Energy flows: Gold gradients → white
- Nodes: Circles; Communospheres: domes/spheres; Spire: faceted obelisk
- Label style: Small caps, letterspacing +2%, muted gray

## Accessibility

- Contrast ratio AA minimum for text
- Non-color cues for states
- Legible type at 16px+ base size
- Motion/light effects kept subtle for sensitivity

## Usage Examples

- Web hero: Radial gradient sky → central spire silhouette; golden light column
- Diagram: Concentric rings with 12 sphere nodes; radial spokes; legend
- Poster: Seed of Life overlaid with city plan; blue/white/gold palette
