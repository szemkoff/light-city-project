# Urban Retrofit Guide

*Applying Light City principles to existing cities at any stage of development*

## Overview

Light City principles aren't just for greenfield development—they can transform existing urban environments. This guide provides **actionable frameworks** for cities like Miami, New York, or any municipality to adopt Light City concepts incrementally.

**Key Insight**: You don't need to build a new city. You can **upgrade consciousness, geometry, and sustainability** into existing infrastructure through policy, design guidelines, and strategic interventions.

---

## Retrofit Framework: 5 Intervention Scales

### **Policy & Code Level** (Citywide)
Embed principles into regulations and incentives

### **District/Neighborhood Level** (1-5 sq mi)
Pilot zones with concentrated interventions

### **Block/Street Level** (1-10 acres)
Tactical urbanism and quick wins

### **Building Level** (Individual structures)
Retrofit guidelines for private development

### **Interior/Unit Level** (Rooms, apartments)
Personal spaces aligned with principles

---

## Policy & Code Interventions

### 1 Sacred Geometry Overlay District

**What**: Zoning overlay that incentivizes sacred geometry in new construction and public space design.

**Implementation**:

  - Fibonacci sequence in setbacks, window spacing
- **Expedited Permitting**: Fast-track projects with sacred geometry elements
- **Public Art Requirement**: 1% of construction cost for sacred geometry installations

**Example Code Language**:
> "Buildings demonstrating sacred geometric principles (golden ratio, Platonic solids, circular forms) in facade design, floor plans, or site layout shall receive a Floor Area Ratio bonus of up to 15%, subject to design review board approval."

**Precedent**:
