*This document explores the energy generation, distribution, and consciousness technologies of Light City*

**Status**: Research & Development  
**Last Updated**: November 7, 2025  
**Owner**: Technical Working Group  
**Related**: [Architecture](/docs/design/architecture), [Technology Catalog](/docs/technical/technology-catalog), [Development Stages](/docs/project/development-stages)

## ⚠️ Claim Discipline

**This page integrates visionary concepts with practical engineering.** All non-conventional mechanisms (zero-point/scalar/torsion/consciousness-coupled power) are **research hypotheses (TRL 1–3)**; all essential electricity comes from a **conventional microgrid** until peer-reviewed evidence says otherwise.

**Scope Discipline**: Physical microgrid provides all essential power. Resonance/spire systems are research-grade (TRL 1–3) that influence human experience (light/acoustics) and may augment ecosystems but are **not relied on for baseload power**.

## Overview: Two-Track Energy System

Light City operates on multiple energy levels simultaneously, with clear separation between proven and exploratory technologies:

### Track 1: Physical Energy (Conventional — TRL 6-9)

**Purpose**: Powers all essential systems (lighting, HVAC, kitchens, labs, communications)

**Sources**:
- Solar PV (rooftop, canopies, BIPV)
- Battery storage (lithium-ion or flow batteries)
- Backup generator (diesel/propane for resilience)
- Grid interconnect (if available)

**Status**: Proven, permittable, fundable  
**Budget**: $3M-$10M (Phase 1: 2-5 MWp + 8-20 MWh storage)

### Track 2: Subtle/Consciousness Energy (Research — TRL 1-3)

**Purpose**: Influences human experience, acoustics, lighting programs, ceremonial UX

**Mechanisms** (hypothetical):
- Crystal resonance and piezoelectric effects
- Sacred geometry standing waves
- Consciousness field coherence
- Exploratory: Zero-point/scalar/torsion (no baseload claims)

**Status**: Experimental, requires measurement protocols  
**Budget**: $100K-$500K (Phase 1 research, instrumentation)

## Track 2: Subtle/Consciousness Energy (Research)

### The Crystal Spire: Symbolic + Auxiliary Role

**Primary Functions** (Terrestrial Model):
- **Ceremonial signaling**: Programmable LED lighting visible for miles
- **Acoustic resonance**: Generates harmonic tones (Schumann, Solfeggio frequencies)
- **Wayfinding beacon**: Visual and energetic landmark
- **Research platform**: Consciousness field studies, instrumentation

**NOT Primary Function**: Baseload power generation (that's the microgrid's job)

**Research Focus**: Resonance coherence metrics, consciousness field effects, not generation claims

### Possible Mechanisms (Hypothetical — TRL 1-3)

| Mechanism | Status | TRL | Primary Measure | Safety/Ethics |
|-----------|--------|-----|-----------------|---------------|
| **Crystal resonance / piezo effects** | Literature + benchtop | 2-3 | Q-factor, frequency stability, micro-strain | Field strengths/EMC compliance |
| **Sacred-geometry standing waves** | Concept + acoustic models | 1-2 | Room RT60, modal patterns, listener HRV/EEG | SPL limits (&lt;85 dBA, &lt;45 dBA night) |
| **Zero-point / scalar / torsion** | Exploratory hypotheses | 1 | **No baseload claims**; null tests, anomaly detection | Thermal/EM exposure limits |
| **Consciousness coupling** | Human-subject research | 1-2 | HRV, EEG, heart-brain coherence, group coherence | IRB approval, informed consent, opt-out |

**Research Hygiene**:
- Preregistered protocols (Open Science Framework)
- Blinded/sham sessions where applicable
- Third-party observers and replication
- Publish null results (no p-hacking)
- Public datasets (anonymized)

### Resonant Frequency System

**Acoustic Targets**:
- **Main hall**: RT60 1.6-2.0 s (music, ceremonies)
- **Meditation rooms**: RT60 0.3-0.5 s (clarity, focus)
- **Exterior soundscape**: ≤ 45 dBA at night (residential areas)
- **Frequency stability**: ±10 ppm (crystal oscillator)

**Physiological Targets** (measured in controlled studies):
- **HRV increase**: 10-20% during resonance sessions (vs. baseline)

- **Subjective**: Validated questionnaires (POMS, STAI, mindfulness scales)

**Instrumentation**:
- Spectrum analyzer (FFT, 1 Hz - 20 kHz)
- RT60 measurement system (impulse response, decay time)
- Wearable biosensors (Oura, Whoop, Muse, HeartMath)
- Environmental sensors (temp, humidity, CO₂, EMF)

### Knowledge Transfer Research

![Knowledge Transfer Mechanism](/img/diagrams/knowledge-transfer-mechanism.svg)

*How information flows from individual learning through the resonance field to instant collective reception.*

**Delphin Model** (Off-World Reference): "Whatever they learn in some elevated knowledge form gets transferred to all of the spheres. So they all know the same thing."

**Research Approach**: We treat "field-mediated learning" as a **testable phenomenon**:
- **Preregistered protocols**: Hypothesis, methods, analysis plan published before data collection
- **Sham sessions**: Control groups with no resonance field active
- **Third-party observers**: Independent researchers verify results
- **Public datasets**: Anonymized data available for replication
- **Outcomes inform pedagogy**: Not claims of "instant download," but enhanced learning environments

**Measurement**:
- Learning speed (time to mastery)
- Retention (recall after 1 week, 1 month)
- Transfer (apply to new contexts)
- Group coherence (synchronized brainwaves during learning)
- Subjective experience (phenomenological interviews)

**Ethics**:
- Informed consent (detailed disclosure of experimental nature)
- Right to withdraw (no penalty)
- Privacy (thoughts are not "broadcast" without consent)
- Opt-out zones (quiet rooms, no-program hours)
