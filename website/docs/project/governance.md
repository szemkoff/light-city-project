# Governance Framework

*Decision-making, authority, and community structure for Light City*

**Version**: 1.0  
**Last Updated**: November 14, 2025  
**Status**: Foundational Framework  
**Related**: [Development Stages](/docs/project/development-stages), [Core Concepts](/docs/concepts/core-concepts)

---

## Overview

Light City's governance evolves through development stages, transitioning from founder-led (Stages 1-4) to community-governed (Stages 5-6) while maintaining vision integrity and operational effectiveness.

### Governance Principles

1. **Transparency**: All decisions documented and accessible
2. **Participation**: Residents have voice in decisions affecting them
3. **Accountability**: Clear authority and responsibility
4. **Evolution**: Structure adapts as community grows
5. **Unity + Autonomy**: Collective alignment with individual sovereignty

---

## Legal Structure

### Stage 1-4: Development Phase

**Entity**: Light City Development, LLC (Delaware)

**Structure**:
- **Managing Member**: Founder (Stan Zemskoff)
- **Advisory Board**: 3-5 advisors (strategic guidance, no voting power)
- **Purpose**: Develop vision, raise capital, design, build community

**Authority**:
- Founder has final decision-making authority
- Advisory board provides input on major decisions
- Community feedback welcomed but not binding

**Rationale**: Agility and speed required during development; single point of accountability for investors

### Stage 5-6: Operational Phase

**Entity Transition** (Year 3-5):
- **Option A**: Convert to Co-op (resident ownership)
- **Option B**: Create dual structure (LLC + Community Association)
- **Option C**: Benefit Corporation (mission + profit)

**Structure** (Post-Transition):
- **Community Council**: Elected representatives (1 per 50 residents)
- **Founder**: Vision Keeper (advisory role, veto on core principles only)
- **Executive Director**: Day-to-day operations (hired by council)
- **Committees**: Finance, Facilities, Programs, Conflict Resolution

**Authority**:
- Community Council makes operational decisions (budget, policies, staffing)
- Founder retains veto on core principles (see below)
- Major decisions require consent-based approval (80% threshold)

## Decision-Making Framework

### Decision Types & Authority

| Decision Type | Stage 1-4 | Stage 5-6 | Threshold |
|---------------|-----------|-----------|-----------|
| **Vision/Principles** | Founder | Founder (veto only) | N/A |

| **Operations** | Founder/Staff | Executive Director | N/A |

### Core Principles (Founder Veto Rights)

**Immutable Principles** (require founder consent to change):
1. Unity consciousness and higher ethics as foundational values
2. Sacred geometry and biophilic design in all structures
