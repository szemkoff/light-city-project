## Navigation Between Stages

### Progression Criteria

Each stage completion is marked by:
1. **Achieving all key deliverables** (documented and published)
2. **Community readiness for next phase** (vote/consent recorded)
3. **Necessary resources secured** (budget, team, partners committed)
4. **Clear vision for next stage** (plan documented and reviewed)
5. **Documentation of learnings** (retrospective published)

### Flexibility

These stages are guideposts, not rigid requirements. The project may:
- Move through stages at different speeds (based on resources and readiness)
- Work on multiple stages simultaneously (e.g., Stage 3 + 4 overlap)
- Return to earlier stages for refinement (iterative, not linear)
- Skip or combine stages as appropriate (context-dependent)
- Create entirely new stages as needed (emergent design)

## Financial Model Notes & Assumptions

### Cross-Subsidy Structure

**Unit Economics**:
| Unit Type | Monthly Fee | Annual | Per-Resident Cost | Margin |
|-----------|-------------|--------|-------------------|---------|
| Tiny Home | $500-$700 | $6K-$8.4K | $8.7K-$18K | ❌ Loss leader |
| Studio | $700-$950 | $8.4K-$11.4K | $8.7K-$18K | ≈ Break-even |
| 1-Bedroom | $950-$1,300 | $11.4K-$15.6K | $8.7K-$18K | ✅ Profitable |
| 2-Bedroom | $1,300-$1,700 | $15.6K-$20.4K | $8.7K-$18K | ✅ Profitable |

**Cross-Subsidy Strategy**:
1. **Tiny homes** (25% of units) operate at loss, subsidized by larger units + retreat revenue
2. **Studios** (40% of units) approximately break-even
3. **1-BR and 2-BR** (35% of units) generate profit margin
4. **Retreat revenue** ($400K-$900K/year) is **essential**, not optional

### Critical Success Factors

**Revenue Dependencies**:
- **Occupancy**: 90%+ required for break-even (80% occupancy = operating loss)
- **Retreat Revenue**: Must achieve 800-1,500 guests/year @ $500-$600/guest
- **Unit Mix**: Cannot exceed 25% tiny homes without increasing fees
- **Pricing Power**: Must maintain fees within $500-$1,700 range (market competitive)

### Sensitivity Analysis

**10% Revenue Drop Scenarios**:
| Scenario | Impact | Mitigation |
|----------|--------|------------|
| Occupancy drops to 80% | -$185K-$252K/year | Increase marketing, improve retention |
| Retreat bookings -10% | -$40K-$90K/year | Diversify retreat offerings, partnerships |
| Fee resistance (5% discount) | -$93K-$126K/year | Value-add services, improve experience |
| **Combined worst case** | -$318K-$468K/year | Draw from reserves, cut discretionary costs |

**Risk Mitigation**:
1. **Build 12-18 month operating reserve** ($1.8M-$4.5M) before opening
2. **Guarantee minimum retreat bookings** (pre-sell 50% of Year 1 capacity)
3. **Dynamic pricing** (adjust fees based on demand, +/- 10%)
4. **Limit tiny homes** to 25% of total units (currently appropriate)
5. **Diversify revenue** (events, agritourism, licensing)

### Break-Even Analysis

**Base Case** (Mid Scenario):
- **Residents**: 180 @ average $925/month = $2.0M/year
- **Retreats**: 1,000 guests @ $550 = $550K/year
- **Other**: Events, agritourism, licensing = $300K/year
- **Total Revenue**: $2.85M/year
- **Total OPEX**: $2.5M/year
- **Margin**: $350K/year (12% margin)

**Conservative Case** (Low Scenario):
- **Residents**: 160 @ average $800/month = $1.54M/year
- **Retreats**: 800 guests @ $500 = $400K/year
- **Other**: $200K/year
- **Total Revenue**: $2.14M/year
- **Total OPEX**: $1.8M/year
- **Margin**: $340K/year (16% margin)

**Optimistic Case** (High Scenario):
- **Residents**: 220 @ average $1,100/month = $2.9M/year
- **Retreats**: 1,500 guests @ $600 = $900K/year
- **Other**: $450K/year
- **Total Revenue**: $4.25M/year
- **Total OPEX**: $3.6M/year
- **Margin**: $650K/year (15% margin)
