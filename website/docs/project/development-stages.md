# Development Stages

The Light City project unfolds through six evolutionary stages, each building upon the previous foundation.

![Development Roadmap](/img/diagrams/development-roadmap.svg)

This comprehensive roadmap shows the complete journey from initial vision to thriving civilization. Each stage builds upon the previous, with flexible timelines based on consciousness shift, resources, and collective readiness.

## Navigation Between Stages

### Progression Criteria

Each stage completion is marked by:
1. **Achieving all key deliverables** (documented and published)
2. **Community readiness for next phase** (vote/consent recorded)
3. **Necessary resources secured** (budget, team, partners committed)
4. **Clear vision for next stage** (plan documented and reviewed)
5. **Documentation of learnings** (retrospective published)

### Flexibility

These stages are guideposts, not rigid requirements. The project may:
- Move through stages at different speeds (based on resources and readiness)
- Work on multiple stages simultaneously (e.g., Stage 3 + 4 overlap)
- Return to earlier stages for refinement (iterative, not linear)
- Skip or combine stages as appropriate (context-dependent)
- Create entirely new stages as needed (emergent design)
