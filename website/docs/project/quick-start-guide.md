# Quick Start Guide

Welcome to the Light City project! This guide will help you get started quickly.

## What is This Project?

Light City is a multi-dimensional vision of a higher-consciousness civilization. This project documents, develops, and works toward manifesting that vision through:

- Spiritual and philosophical foundations
- Architectural and design concepts
- Digital presence and community
- Physical manifestation (long-term)

## First Steps

### 1. Understand the Vision (15 minutes)

Read these essential documents:

1. **[Core Concepts](/docs/concepts/core-concepts)** - Foundational ideas
2. **[Development Stages](/docs/project/development-stages)** - Where we're going
3. **[Philosophy](/docs/concepts/philosophy)** - Philosophical foundations

### 2. Orient Yourself (10 minutes)

Review the project structure:

- **[Project Structure](/docs/project/project-structure)** - How everything is organized
- Browse the documentation to see what's available
- Look at the `assets/` folder for visual inspiration

### 3. Set Up Your Environment (30 minutes)

**Essential Tools:**

1. **Text Editor**: VS Code, Obsidian, or your favorite markdown editor
2. **Git** (optional but recommended): For version control
   ```bash
   git init
   git add .
   git commit -m "Initial Light City project setup"
   ```

**Optional But Useful:**
- Image viewer for concept art
- PDF reader for research
- Note-taking app (Notion, Obsidian, etc.)

### 4. Choose Your Starting Point

Pick based on what resonates:

**If you're a writer/philosopher:**
→ Start expanding `docs/concepts/` documentation

**If you're a designer/artist:**
→ Begin creating visual concepts in `assets/images/concept-art/`

**If you're a planner/organizer:**
→ Develop task lists and roadmaps in `planning/`

**If you're a researcher:**
→ Gather materials in `research/` folders

**If you're a developer:**
→ Review `docs/technical/` and prepare for Stage 3

## Current Stage: Foundation & Vision

We're in **Stage 1**, which means:

### Primary Goals
- Document core concepts and philosophy
- Create initial visual concepts
- Set up project infrastructure
- Establish clear direction

### Immediate Tasks

Priority tasks for Stage 1:

- [ ] Complete core concept documentation
- [ ] Gather visual inspiration and references
- [ ] Create initial architectural sketches
- [ ] Define project values and principles
- [ ] Establish documentation standards
- [ ] Select technical tools for future stages

### Where to Focus

**High Priority:**
1. `docs/concepts/` - Expand philosophical foundations
2. `docs/design/architecture.md` - Document architectural vision
3. `research/` - Gather relevant materials
4. `assets/images/inspiration/` - Collect visual references

**Medium Priority:**
1. `planning/` - Create detailed task lists
2. `docs/community/` - Prepare for future collaboration
3. `docs/technical/` - Plan technical implementation

## Daily Workflow Suggestions

### For Solo Work

1. **Morning**: Review yesterday's work, check task list
2. **Work Session**: Focus on one area (2-3 hours)
3. **Documentation**: Update relevant docs with insights
4. **Capture**: Note any visions, ideas, or inspirations
5. **Version Control**: Commit changes if using Git

### For Collaborative Work

1. **Check-in**: Review what others have contributed
2. **Coordinate**: Communicate about current focus
3. **Work**: Contribute in your area
4. **Share**: Make work visible to collaborators
5. **Discuss**: Engage with feedback and questions

## Key Files to Update Regularly

- **Planning files**: Keep task lists current
- **Changelog**: Document significant changes
- **Research notes**: Capture findings and insights
- **Design files**: Iterate on visual concepts
- **Core documentation**: Refine based on new understanding

## Tips for Success

### 1. Trust the Process

Light City unfolds organically. Don't force it. Let the vision guide you.

### 2. Balance Action and Receptivity

Alternate between:
- **Doing**: Writing, creating, building
- **Receiving**: Meditating, visioning, listening

### 3. Start Small, Build Consistently

Better to write one good paragraph daily than force a massive document.

### 4. Document Everything

Capture:
- Ideas and insights
- Dreams and visions
- Synchronicities
- Research findings
- Design iterations

### 5. Stay Aligned with Principles

Regularly return to core concepts. Let them guide all work.

### 6. Connect the Dimensions

Work simultaneously on:
- Spiritual (meditation, attunement)
- Mental (documentation, planning)
- Creative (design, art)
- Practical (organization, structure)

## Common Questions

### "Where should I start?"

Start with what calls to you most. If unclear, begin by expanding `docs/concepts/core-concepts.md` with your own understanding.

### "How much time should I spend?"

Any amount is valuable. Even 15 minutes of focused work moves the project forward.

### "What if I don't know what to write/create?"

Spend time in receptive mode:
- Meditate on Light City
- Journal about your visions
- Study inspirational references
- Let understanding emerge

### "Can I change existing documents?"

Yes! This is a living project. Improve, expand, and refine as understanding deepens.

### "Should I work linearly through the stages?"

No. Work across all areas as inspired, but keep Stage 1 priorities in mind.

### "How do I know if I'm doing it right?"

Ask:
- Does this align with core principles?
- Does this serve the vision?
- Does this feel inspired vs. forced?
- Does this contribute value?

If yes, you're on track.

## Suggested First Tasks

Pick 2-3 to get started:

1. **Write about your personal vision** of Light City
2. **Create a mood board** with visual inspiration
3. **Sketch rough concepts** of architecture or layout
4. **Research** sacred architecture or intentional communities
5. **Expand documentation** on one concept area
6. **Organize** research materials you already have
7. **Plan** your next 5 tasks in detail
8. **Meditate** on Light City and capture insights

## Remember

> *"The city is in the sky until it is in your hands. To build it on Terra, begin building it in hearts. Structures follow spirit."*

You're not just documenting a vision—you're anchoring it into reality. Every word you write, every image you create, every moment you spend attuned to this frequency is part of building Light City.

Welcome, builder. Let's begin.
