## Overview

Light City offers a **Contribution-Based Residency (CBR)** program where community members can live rent-free by contributing their time, skills, and energy to the community. This model recognizes that **value comes in many forms** - not just money - and creates pathways for people who are rich in time, skills, or passion but may not have financial resources.

:::tip Philosophy
**"From each according to their ability, to each according to their need"** - but voluntarily chosen, clearly structured, and mutually beneficial.
:::

## Core Principles

### 1. **Voluntary Participation**
- No one is forced into work-exchange
- Clear opt-in/opt-out processes
- Can switch between paid and contribution-based residency

### 2. **Fair Value Exchange**
- Contribution hours valued at local living wage
- Transparent calculation of housing value
- Regular reviews to ensure fairness

### 3. **Diverse Contributions**
- Physical labor (building, gardening, maintenance)
- Skilled work (teaching, healing, design, tech)
- Care work (childcare, eldercare, community support)
- Creative work (art, music, storytelling, documentation)
- Governance (facilitation, conflict resolution, planning)

### 4. **Dignity & Autonomy**
- Contributors are **full community members**, not "workers"
- Same voting rights and access as paying residents
- No second-class status
- Freedom to choose contribution areas

### 5. **Sustainability**
- Program must be financially viable for the community
- Limited number of CBR spots (20-30% of total residents)
- Balanced with revenue-generating residents

## Financial Model

### **How It Works for the Community**

#### **Cost to House 1 CBR Resident** (per month):
- Housing (amortized): $200
- Utilities: $100
- Food: $300
- Healthcare: $50
- Operations: $100
- **Total**: $750/month

#### **Value of Contribution** (25 hrs/week):
- 25 hrs/week × 4 weeks = 100 hrs/month
- @ $15/hr (local living wage) = **$1,500/month value**

#### **Net Benefit to Community**:
- Value provided: $1,500
- Cost to support: $750
- **Net gain**: $750/month per CBR resident

:::info Why This Works
CBR residents provide **labor that would otherwise need to be paid for** (gardening, maintenance, childcare, teaching). By exchanging housing for this labor, the community saves money while providing opportunity.
:::

### **Revenue Impact Analysis**

#### **Scenario: 200-person community**
- 140 paying residents (70%) @ $1,200/month avg = $168,000/month
- 60 CBR residents (30%) providing 6,000 hrs/month labor
- Equivalent labor cost if hired: $90,000/month
- Actual cost to support CBR residents: $45,000/month
- **Net savings**: $45,000/month

#### **Break-Even Analysis**:
- Maximum CBR capacity: 30-35% of total residents
- Beyond this, revenue impact becomes negative
- Sweet spot: 25-30% CBR residents

## Contribution Tracking System

### **Digital Platform** (Stage 4 implementation)

#### **Features**:
1. **Contribution Logging**
   - Mobile app for clocking in/out
   - Category tagging (food, maintenance, care, etc.)
   - Photo/note documentation

2. **Scheduling**
   - Weekly shift calendar
   - Swap shifts with other CBR residents
   - Request time off

3. **Impact Tracking**
   - Hours contributed (weekly, monthly, yearly)
   - Projects completed
   - Skills developed
   - Community feedback

4. **Transparency**
   - Public dashboard showing total community contributions
   - Individual contribution summaries (private)
   - Quarterly reports

### **Low-Tech Backup** (Stage 1-3)
- Paper sign-in sheets
- Weekly check-ins with coordinator
- Monthly contribution summaries
- Community bulletin board

---

## Governance & Accountability

### **CBR Council**
- 5-7 members (mix of CBR and paying residents)
- Elected annually
- Responsibilities:
  - Review applications
  - Resolve contribution disputes
  - Adjust program as needed
  - Ensure fairness and sustainability

### **Quarterly Reviews**
- Every CBR resident meets with coordinator
- Review contribution hours and quality
- Discuss challenges and adjustments
- Celebrate successes

### **Conflict Resolution**
If a CBR resident:
- Consistently misses contribution hours
- Doesn't show up for shifts
- Provides low-quality work
- Causes interpersonal conflicts

**Process**:
1. **Conversation** (informal check-in)
2. **Mediation** (with neutral facilitator)
3. **Adjustment** (change contribution areas or hours)
4. **Probation** (30-day improvement period)
5. **Transition** (move to paying residency or leave community)

:::tip Restorative Approach
Focus is on **understanding and support**, not punishment. Most issues stem from misalignment, burnout, or personal challenges - all solvable with care.

## Success Stories (Visionary Examples)

**Duration**: 2 years (now transitioning to paid residency with remote work)

### **James - Builder & Educator**

## FAQ

### **Q: Is this like a commune?**
**A**: Similar spirit, but more structured and sustainable. CBR is voluntary, time-limited, and financially viable. You can opt in/out and switch to paying residency anytime.

### **Q: What if I can't work 25 hours/week due to disability?**
**A**: We offer **accessibility accommodations**. Contribution can be adjusted based on ability - maybe 10 hrs/week of what you *can* do, plus a small monthly payment. We work with each person individually.

### **Q: Can I do CBR while also having a part-time job?**
**A**: Yes! Tier 2 (15-20 hrs/week) is designed for this. Or do Tier 1 and save money from your part-time job.

### **Q: What happens if I get sick or have an emergency?**
**A**: We have **contribution insurance** - up to 2 weeks/year of excused absences for illness, family emergencies, or personal crises. Community covers your shifts.

### **Q: Is there a waiting list?**
**A**: Likely, yes (once we launch). CBR spots are limited to maintain financial sustainability. Typical wait: 3-6 months.

### **Q: Can families participate?**
**A**: Yes! Families can share contribution hours. Example: 2 adults contribute 15 hrs/week each (30 total) for a 2-bedroom home.

### **Q: What if I want to leave?**
**A**: Give 30 days notice. No penalties, no judgment. We'll celebrate your time with us and support your transition.
