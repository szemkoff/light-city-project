# 🌟 Start Here

Welcome to the **Light City Project** – a vision of higher-consciousness civilization being anchored from etheric potential into manifest reality.

## What You're Looking At

This is a comprehensive framework for documenting, developing, and manifesting Light City through six evolutionary stages, from initial vision to living reality.

## Your First Steps

### 1. Understand the Vision (10 minutes)

Read these three documents in order:

1. **[Project Overview](INDEX.md)** - What is this project?
2. **[Core Concepts](concepts/core-concepts.md)** - What is Light City?
3. **[Development Stages](project/development-stages.md)** - Where are we going?

### 2. Get Oriented (5 minutes)

- **[Quick Start Guide](project/quick-start-guide.md)** - Practical next steps
- **[Project Structure](project/project-structure.md)** - How everything is organized
- **[Documentation Index](INDEX.md)** - Complete file map

### 3. Choose Your Path

**If you want to contribute:**
→ Read [Contributing Guidelines](docs/project/contributing.md)

**If you're setting up to work:**
→ Read [Tools and Workflows](docs/project/tools-and-workflows.md)

**If you want to understand deeply:**
→ Explore [Philosophy](concepts/philosophy.md) and [Architecture](design/architecture.md)

**If you're planning your work:**
→ Check [Stage 1 Tasks](project/stage-1-tasks.md)

## Current Status

**Stage**: 1 - Foundation & Vision  
**Started**: October 10, 2025  
**Completion**: ~30% of Stage 1 objectives

**What exists now:**
- ✅ Complete project structure
- ✅ Core documentation framework
- ✅ Philosophical foundations (initial)
- ✅ Architectural vision (initial)
- ✅ Project management framework
- ⏳ Visual design (not started)
- ⏳ Research collection (not started)

## Immediate Priorities

The project needs:

1. **Documentation expansion** in `docs/concepts/` and `docs/design/`
2. **Visual concepts** - mood boards, sketches, concept art
3. **Research gathering** - references and inspiration
4. **Daily work rhythm** - consistent progress

## Key Principles to Remember

> *"The city is in the sky until it is in your hands."*  
> *"To build it on Terra, begin building it in hearts."*  
> *"Structures follow spirit."*

**Work across all dimensions:**
- Spiritual (meditation, attunement)
- Mental (documentation, planning)  
- Creative (design, art)
- Practical (organization, action)
