## Future Illustrations to Add

As the project develops, consider adding:

1. **Geometric Diagrams**
   - Sacred geometry overlays (Flower of Life, Merkaba, etc.)
   - City layout schematic showing rings and pathways
   - Spire proportions and dimensions

2. **Concept Renderings**
   - 3D city layout from various angles
   - Communosphere interior designs
   - Spire internal structure

3. **Energy System Diagrams**
   - Crystal energy flow pathways
   - Resonance field visualization
   - Power distribution network

4. **Comparative Analysis**
   - Side-by-side geometry comparisons (Light City vs. Borobudur vs. Angkor)
   - Timeline showing architectural evolution
   - Cross-cultural sacred site comparisons

5. **Phase Plans**
   - Stage-by-stage construction vision
   - Material studies
   - Landscape integration plans

## Next Steps for Visual Documentation

The foundation is set with inspiration images. Future development can include:

- Professional architectural renderings
- 3D models and visualizations
- Schematic diagrams of energy and geometric systems
- Documentary photography of construction phases
- Artist renderings of interior spaces
- Landscape integration studies

Each illustration should serve the dual purpose of:
1. **Clarity**: Helping viewers understand concepts
2. **Inspiration**: Elevating consciousness and vision alignment
